#Task 1: Perform Basic Mathematical Operations
#Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
#1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
#2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
#o	Addition
#o	Subtraction
#o	Multiplication
#o	Division
#3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
#.........................................................
Value1=float(input("Enter First Value: "))
Value2=float(input("Enter Second Value: "))
Addition = Value1 + Value2
Subtraction = Value1 - Value2
Multiplication = Value1 * Value2
Division = Value1 / Value2
print("Addition: ", Addition)
print("Subtraction: ", Subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", Multiplication)
print("Division: ", Division)
